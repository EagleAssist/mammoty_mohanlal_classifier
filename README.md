# mammoty_mohanlal_classifier
## Project Overview
This project involves building an image classifier for distinguishing between images of two  actors, Mammootty and Mohanlal, using deep learning techniques. The classifier is implemented using the Sequential model from Keras and leverages the pre-trained architectures VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet for a comparative study.
## Dataset
The dataset comprises a collection of images featuring Mammootty and Mohanlal. 
## Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
vgg16
vgg19
resnet
inceptionv3
## Resut
The comparative study reveals that InceptionV3 achieved the highest accuracy among the tested models
